# Reinforcement Learning & Chung Toi

Through this project, we aim to train a simple reinforcement learning agent to play the game Chung Toi. We are trying to make the interface and the algorithm used as simple as possible for this project.

Chung Toi is one of Dhruv's family's favorite pastimes, so to train an agent on this game is an interesting project to me personally. Samik is the GOAT so he had to be on the project too haha.
